## About me 💫

👩‍💻 I’m currently working on two projects on the topic of brain health: 
- 🧠 **Neurological Impacts of Long COVID**: Analyzing MRI data to understand the impact of long COVID on brain structure and connectivity, focusing on various microstructual properties of white and grey matter. 
- 👩‍🚀 **Neuroplasticity in Long-Term Microgravity**: Exploring the effects of long-term exposure to microgravity on brain structure and function using astronaut MRI data. 

🌱 I’m currently learning about **Machine Learning**, diving into how it can be applied to data analysis in neuroscience and biophysics. 

✨ Fun fact: I'm passionate about **space exploration** and its implications for **space health**, constantly fascinated by how the human brain adapts to the challenges of space travel. I also serve as the **Project Manager** for the **Space Health division at Space Concordia**, where I work on research initiatives related to space health.
